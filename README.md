## How to add bots
This is up to the bot api owner to add, but if its like msgroom-orm, here's how to do it \
Your client should look like:
```js
const client = new Client("TestBot", [ "!" ]);
```
Now, it's really easy, just add a new argument to Client with an object containing the arguments \
If you don't understand anything, just do it like this:
```js
//                                                             <DOMAIN>   <PORT>
const client = new Client("TestBot", [ "!" ], { server: "wss://example.com:4096" });
```
**Congrats! üéâ** Your bot should now work with MRCS!
